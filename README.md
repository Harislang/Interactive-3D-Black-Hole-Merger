Overview
This project provides an interactive 3D scene that models a binary black hole merger with attention to physically motivated visuals. You’ll see gravitational lensing shaping the light paths around the black holes, and wave-like disturbances that resemble gravitational waves in the scene. The experience is designed to be approachable for students, educators, and curious minds who want a tangible feel for this cosmic phenomenon. The engine behind the visuals is Three.js, with WebGL handling the GPU work for fast rendering on typical laptops, tablets, and desktops.

Why this project matters
- Education in a visual medium: Complex astrophysical phenomena become accessible when students can manipulate parameters and observe outcomes in real time.
- Safe exploration of extreme physics: The model simplifies some details for clarity, while preserving the essential relationships between mass, distance, lensing, and waveform appearance.
- Reproducibility and open science: The codebase invites educators to tailor demonstrations, capture screenshots, and craft lesson plans grounded in interactive experiments.
- Cross-disciplinary learning: The project blends physics, computer graphics, and software engineering, supporting STEM education and maker workflows.

Core features
- Realistic 3D visualization: A pair of black holes orbit and merge in a dynamic, room-scale space.
- Gravitational lensing: Light paths bend around each mass, producing warped, luminous rings and arcs that shift as the system evolves.
- Wave effects: Subtle, wave-like ripples propagate through the scene to evoke gravitational waves without requiring heavy instrumentation.
- Interactive camera controls: Orbit, pan, and zoom to explore the merger from any angle.
- parameter tuning: Adjust mass ratio, orbital separation, spin, and distance to see how the merger evolves.
- High-fidelity shading: Physically inspired shading and lensing effects that respond to camera position and object motion.
- WebGL and Three.js backbone: Smooth performance on modern hardware with broad browser support.
- Educational annotations: In-scene labels and overlays to highlight key concepts like event horizons, photon orbits, and lensing caustics.

How it works under the hood
- Scene graph and rendering: The core scene uses Three.js to manage geometries, lights, cameras, and post-processing. Shaders handle lensing distortions and wave-like textures.
- Binary black hole model: Each black hole is represented as a compact, moving mass that exerts gravitational influence on light in the scene. The orbital motion follows a simplified two-body dynamics model that captures essential features of a merger.
- Gravitational lensing: Instead of full general relativistic ray tracing, the project uses an efficient approximation that bends light as it travels near the masses. The result is visually faithful and fast to compute in real time.
- Wave effects: Time-varying shader parameters create concentric wave patterns that propagate through space, reinforcing the sense of a dynamic gravitational field without heavy computation.
- Interactivity: Mouse and touch input are mapped to camera transforms and parameter controls. The app updates in a requestAnimationFrame loop to keep visuals fluid.
- Asset pipeline: Lightweight textures and procedural noise drive surface detail, while vector data and shader uniforms encode the physics cues students need to observe.

Live previews and media
- Concept art and still frames demonstrate the visual language: lensing ribbons, bright arcs spiraling around the black holes, and subtle ripples in the space between objects.
- Screenshots illustrate common viewpoints, such as a side-on view showing lensing caustics and a top-down view of the binary dance.
- A short demo video (where available) summarizing the visual effects and user interactions can be linked on the release page for quick orientation.

Visual and physical fidelity
- Physics-inspired realism
  - The model emphasizes how mass and distance influence the light paths and the apparent shape of the scene.
  - Lensing distortions grow stronger as the black holes approach each other, creating dramatic arcs and multiple images in the viewer’s frame.
  - The wave-like effects convey the concept of spacetime perturbations without requiring complex gravitational wave computation.
- Aesthetic choices
  - Color palettes highlight hot regions near the event horizons and cooler space far from the masses.
  - Subtle glow and glow radius controls add depth without overwhelming the main actions.
  - Particles and streaks emphasize motion and energy exchange during the merger.
- Performance considerations
  - The rendering pipeline uses GPU shaders for lensing and wave effects, keeping updates smooth on mid-range hardware.
  - LOD (level of detail) strategies are employed so the scene remains responsive when the camera is in busy regions or when many particles are present.
  - Optional post-processing can be toggled to reduce GPU load on older devices.

Educational use cases
- Classroom demonstrations
  - Use the parameter controls to illustrate how mass and distance affect gravitational lensing and merger dynamics.
  - Highlight the concept of photon paths bending near massive objects and how this leads to multiple images and arcs.
  - Show how the merger emits energy and how the time scale influences perception of the event.
- Student-led explorations
  - Students can create a guided exploration by setting up presets that demonstrate specific phenomena (for example, a near-equal mass merger vs. a high mass ratio scenario).
  - Worksheets can prompt students to predict visual outcomes before running simulations and then compare with observed results.
- Teachers and educators
  - A resource to complement astrophysics units, space science fairs, and STEM outreach programs.
  - A safe, self-contained environment for urban or remote classrooms without needing specialized hardware beyond a browser.

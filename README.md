## 🔬 Physics Implementation

### Gravitational Dynamics

The simulation implements classical Newtonian gravity with relativistic corrections:

```javascript
F = G * m1 * m2 / r²
```

### Energy Loss via Gravitational Waves

Based on the Peters-Mathews formula for orbital decay:

```javascript
dE/dt = -(32/5) * (G⁴/c⁵) * (m1² * m2² * (m1+m2)) / r⁵
```

### Mass-Energy Conversion

During merger, approximately 5% of the total mass is converted to gravitational wave energy, following Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.

### Schwarzschild Radius

The event horizon radius is calculated as:
```javascript
Rs = 2GM/c²
```

## üî¨ Physics Implementation

### Gravitational Dynamics

The simulation implements classical Newtonian gravity with relativistic corrections:

```javascript
F = G * m1 * m2 / r¬≤
```

### Energy Loss via Gravitational Waves

Based on the Peters-Mathews formula for orbital decay:

```javascript
dE/dt = -(32/5) * (G‚Å¥/c‚Åµ) * (m1¬≤ * m2¬≤ * (m1+m2)) / r‚Åµ
```

### Mass-Energy Conversion

During merger, approximately 5% of the total mass is converted to gravitational wave energy, following Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.

### Schwarzschild Radius

The event horizon radius is calculated as:
```javascript
Rs = 2GM/c¬≤
```

## üìä Performance Optimization

- **Particle Systems**: Efficient buffer geometry for 90,000+ particles
- **Level-of-Detail**: Dynamic quality adjustments based on performance
- **Frustum Culling**: Automatic Three.js optimization
- **GPU Acceleration**: WebGL shaders for complex calculations
- **Adaptive Quality**: Pixel ratio capped at 2x for high-DPI displays
